# Mere Whimsy, a sway(fx) dotfile

Many design choices were made during the development of this rice, most of them were made on a whim. 

## Stuff I use 
- Compositor: swayfx
- App launcher: wofi
- Bar: eww
- Font: Roboto Mono Nerd Font
- Terminal: foot

### Other dependencies
- playerctl
- grim
- i3ipc
- pamixer
- brightnessctl
- swaylock
- mpd and mpDris2
- A file under `~/Document/fuck.txt`. This is a to-do list.
